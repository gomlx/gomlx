// BatchNormalization performs a batch normalization layer on the input. It includes a scaling and offset factor,
// and normalization over the batch entries. It maintains a moving average mean and variance of the inputs
// which is later used during inference.
//
// featureAxis is the axis over which **not to normalize**: this will normalize over the other dimensions,
// calculating the mean and variance by reducing all other dimensions.
// E.g: if your input is `[batch_size, features]` you should use featureAxis=1 (same as -1) to normalize over
// the batch; if your input is an image of shape `[batch_size, height, width, channels]` you should use
// featureAxis=3 (same as -1) to normalize over the batch and all the pixels, so each channel is
// normalized differently, but normalization happens over all the pixes of the whole batch.
//
// Notice the difference between LayerNormalization, that normalizes over the feature dimensions, as opposed
// to the batch dimension.
//
// To ease setting its parameters, it returns a BatchNormBuilder object for configuration. Once it is
// set up call `BatchNormBuilder.Done` and it will return the normalized x. Browse through BatchNormBuilder to see the
// capabilities and the defaults.
//
// Batch normalization behaves differently during training and inference: during training it normalizes over
// the batch (so it likely won't work well for very small batch sizes), and in inference, it normalizes
// using the collected moving average of the mean and variance.
//
// Based on paper "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing
// Internal Covariate Shift" (Sergey Ioffe, Christian Szegedy), https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167.

// 1. Support padding by not normalizing parts that weren't touched.
