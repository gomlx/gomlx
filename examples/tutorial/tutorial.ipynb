    "## Backends and executing Graphs with `graph.Exec`\n",
    "\n",
    "**GoMLX** can work with different backends to execute its operations. Currently 2 backends are supported:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `\"xla\"`: It uses [OpenXLA/XLA](https://openxla.org/), a \"state of the art\" execution engine for ML operations, that supports CPU (with SIMD), various accelerators (GPUs, TPUs), JIT (Just In Time) compilation, providing the best performance. For now though, it only works in Linux/amd64 platform.\n",
    "2. `\"go\"` (aka. _SimpleGo_): A pure Go backend engine. Much slower than `xla`, but very portable, likely will work in all platforms supported by Go -- tested in Linux, Windows, WASM (yes, it runs in the browser).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both backends are included if you `import _ \"github.com/gomlx/gomlx/backends/default\"` like in the example below (`xla` is excluded if not Linux). \n",
    "But you can build your binary only with xla with `import _ \"github.com/gomlx/gomlx/backends/stablehlo\"` or only `go` with `import _ \"github.com/gomlx/gomlx/backends/simplego\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a `backends.Backend` object is trivial: `backends.New()` (or `backends.MustNew()`). If the environment variable `GOMLX_BACKEND` is set, it can define the backend and its configuration (e.g.: `\"go\"`, `\"xla:cpu\"`, `\"xla:cuda\"`, etc.). Here we set it to `xla:cpu` to force the CPU backend for this tutorial.\n",

Tensors have a shape (`shapes.Shape`) just like a `graph.Node`.\n",

    "Example: because some of the resources are allocated in the accelerator (GPU) and not managed by Go, the garbage collector may not be aware of the memory pressure on these devices--there is a `Tensor.Finalize` call that immediately releases the data associated with a tensor.\n",

    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the computers just \"don't get it\": they do exactly what we tell them to do,\n",
    "as opposed to what we want them to do, and thus programs fail or crash.\n",
    "And AIs sometimes \"get it\", but still write wrong programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "GoMLX provides different ways to track down various types of errors. The most commonly used below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good old \"printf\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It's convenient because of Go fast compilation (change something and run to see what one gets is\n",
    "almost instant). Logging results to stdout is a valid way of developing. During graph building development,\n",
    "often one prints the shape of the `Node` being operated to confirm (or not) one's expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Errors in **GoMLX** have stacktrace\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors during the building of the graph are reported back with `panic`. \n",
    "The `graph.Exec` or `context.Exec` recover and convert them to errors for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "These errors include a stack-trace the tells you exactly where things happened. The stack-grace can be printed with `\"%+v\"` format string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node Shape Asserts\n",
    "\n",
    "During the writing of complex models, it's very common to add comments on the expected shapes of the graph nodes, to\n",
    "facilitate the reader (and developer) of the code to have the right mental model of what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "GoMLX provides a series of _assert_ methods that can be used instead. They serve both as documentation, and an early\n",
    "exit in case of some unexpected results. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a `modelGraph` function could contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "    batch_size := inputs[0].Shape().Dimensions[0]\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    layer := Concatenate(allEmbeddings, -1)\n",
    "    layer.AssertDims(batchSize, -1)  // 2D tensor, with batch size as the leading dimension.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although using these when building graphs is the most common case, there are similar assert functions for tensors and shapes themselves in the package `gomlx/types/shapes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Execution Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "Every `Node` of the graph can be flagged with `SetLogged(msg)`.\n",
    "The executor (`Exec`) will at the end of the execution log all these values. The default logger \n",
    "(set with `Exec.SetLogger`) will simply print the message `msg` along with the value of the `Node` of\n",
    "interest. Creating a specialized loggers that handle arbitrary nodes is trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Catching `NaN` and `Inf` in your training\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common source of headaches when training complex models. \n",
    "The package `nanlogger` implements a specialized logger and monitor results on arbitrary nodes in the graph,\n",
    "and will `panic` with custom messages (and a stack-trace) a the first sight of a `NaN` (or `±Inf`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### More Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests and these methods have been enough to develop most of GoMLX so far. \n",
    "But there are other debugging tools that could be made, see discussion in the [Debugging](https://github.com/gomlx/gomlx/blob/main/docs/debugging.md) document. Let us know if you need something specialized.\n",
