    "## Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the computers just \"don't get it\": they do exactly what we tell them to do,\n",
    "as opposed to what we want them to do, and thus programs fail or crash. \n",
    "GoMLX provides different ways to track down various types of errors. The most commonly used below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Good old \"printf\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It's convenient because of Go fast compilation (change something and run to see what one gets is\n",
    "almost instant). Logging results to stdout is a valid way of developing. During graph building development,\n",
    "often one prints the shape of the `Node` being operated to confirm (or not) one's expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Errors reported with `panic` -- Go \"exceptions\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors during the building of the graph are reported back with `panic`. These can be caught in Go with `recover`,\n",
    "but **GoMLX** offers the `exceptions` library to make it easy. \n",
    "All libraries always `panic` helpful error messages -- they can be printed with `\"%+v\"` to get \n",
    "full stack-trace output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Node Shape Asserts\n",
    "\n",
    "During the writing of complex models, it's very common to add comments on the expected shapes of the graph nodes, to\n",
    "facilitate the reader (and developer) of the code to have the right mental model of what is going on.\n",
    "\n",
    "GoMLX provides a series of _assert_ methods that can be used instead. They serve both as documentation, and an early\n",
    "exit in case of some unexpected results. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a `modelGraph` function could contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "    batch_size := inputs[0].Shape().Dimensions[0]\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    layer := Concatenate(allEmbeddings, -1)\n",
    "    layer.AssertDims(batchSize, -1)  // 2D tensor, with batch size as the leading dimension.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although using these when building graphs is the most common case, there are similar assert functions for tensors and shapes themselves in the package `gomlx/types/shapes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Execution Logging\n",
    "\n",
    "Every `Node` of the graph can be flagged with `SetLogged(msg)`.\n",
    "The executor (`Exec`) will at the end of the execution log all these values. The default logger \n",
    "(set with `Exec.SetLogger`) will simply print the message `msg` along with the value of the `Node` of\n",
    "interest. Creating a specialized loggers that handle arbitrary nodes is trivial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Catching `NaN` and `Inf` in your training\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a common source of headaches when training complex models. \n",
    "The package `nanlogger` implements a specialized logger and monitor results on arbitrary nodes in the graph,\n",
    "and will `panic` with custom messages (and a stack-trace) a the first sight of a `NaN` (or `±Inf`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### More Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests and these methods have been enough to develop most of GoMLX so far. But there are other\n",
    "debugging tools that could be made, see discussion in the [Debugging](https://github.com/gomlx/gomlx/blob/main/docs/debugging.md) document. Let us know if you need something specialized.\n",
    "\n",
