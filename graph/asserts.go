// This file implements various asserts (checks) that can be done on the Node.
// They are derived from the asserts in the shapes package.

// AssertDims checks whether the shape has the given dimensions and rank.
// A value of -1 in dimensions means it can take any value and is not checked.
//
// If the shape is not what was expected, it panics with an error message.
//
// This often serves as documentation for the code when implementing some complex computational
// graphs.
// This allows the reader of the code to corroborate what is the expected shape of a node.
//
// Example:
//
//	batch_size := inputNodes[0].Shape().Dimensions[0]
//	â€¦
//	layer := Concatenate(allEmbeddings, -1)
//	layer.AssertDims(batchSize, -1) // 2D tensor, with batch size as the leading dimension.

// This allows the reader of the code to corroborate what is the expected shape of a node.
