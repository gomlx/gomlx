	// Gather is a powerful but cumbersome Gather operation offered by XLA.
	// Full details in https://www.tensorflow.org/xla/operation_semantics#gather.
	// (Warning: it's circular and cumbersome)
	// The output of Gather has the same DType of the operand, from where we are pulling the data.
	// It's shape will be composed of 2 parts:
	//   - Batch axes: they come from the axes of startIndices, except the "indexVectorAxis" (usually the last)
	//     that is used as the indices into the operand. (*)
	//   - "Offset axes": these are axes that come from the operand, the sizes given by sliceSizes. Notice
	//     that if sliceSizes for an axis is 1, and that axis feature in the collapsedSliceAxes list, this
	//     axis gets omitted in the output.
	// So in general output.Rank() = startIndices.Rank() - 1 + len(offsetAxes).
	// (*) One exception is if indexVectorAxis == startIndices.Rank(), in which case we assume there is an
	// extra virtual axis in startIndices of size 1, in which case output.Rank() = startIndices.Rank() + len(offsetAxes).
	// Arguments:
	//   - operand: the values from where we are gathering. The output DType will follow the operand one.
	//   - startIndices: are the indices we want to gather. There will be one axis pointed by indexVector axis which
	//     enumerates the indices of the slice to be gathered in the operand array (their values are mapped to the axis
	//     in the operand according to startIndexMap).
	//     All other axes are "batch dimensions" and they will have equivalent axes (same dimensions) in the output.
	//   - indexVectorAxis: which of the axis in startIndices is collected and used as the start index for slices
	//     to be gathered in the operand.
	//     It is typically the last axis of startIndices, so startIndices.Shape.Rank()-1.
	//     There is a special case where indexVectorAxis == startIndices.Rank() in which case we assume there is an
	//     extra virtual axis in startIndices of size 1, in which case output.Rank() = startIndices.Rank() + len(offsetAxes).
	//   - offsetOutputAxes: axes in the _output_ (not on the operand) that will hold the "offset slices", slices that are not
	//     collapsed. It points in which position (axis) in the output these slices should show up. Any axis in sliceSizes
	//     that is > 1 must feature here.
	//     Notice all axes in the operand will either become an "offset axis" in the output, if their slice size > 1,
	//     of optionally collapsed (or "squeezed") in the output, if their slice size == 1. We map the axes in the output
	//     (given in offsetAxes) to the axes in the operand (the axes not present in collapsedSliceAxes) sequentially.
	//     One must have Rank(operand) == len(collapsedSliceAxes) + len(offsetAxes).
	//   - collapsedSliceAxes: for sliceSizes that are 1 in the operand, one may not want to include them in the output.
	//     The _operand_ axes included here are marked to be collapsed (removed) in the output. Notice, the corresponding
	//     value in sliceSizes must be 1.
	//     One must have Rank(operand) == len(collapsedSliceAxes) + len(offsetOutputAxes).
	//   - startIndexMap: this maps which value in startIndices is used for which axis index in the slice to be gathered.
	//     Notice len(startIndexMap) must match the startIndices.Shape().Dimensions[indexVectorAxis].
	//     E.g: if startIndices.shape=(2, 3), indexVectorAxis=1, and operand.rank=4 and startIndexMap=[]int{0, 1, 2},
	//     this mean each row of the startIndices will point to the first 3 axis (0,1 and 2) in operand.
	//     In many cases this is [0, 1, 2, ..., operand.Shape.Rank()-1], that is, each "index vector" fully defines
	//     an element on the operand. In some this is only a prefix of the operand's rank.
	//     For those axis in the operand not explicitly set (so if len(startIndexMap) < operand.Rank()), the corresponding
	//     axis start index is considered to be 0, and one sets the sliceSizes to take the slice one wants (typically the
	//     full slice).
	//   - sliceSizes: once the start index from where to gather is resolved, this defines how much data in each axis
	//     to gather. The "offset" output axes (see above) will have dimensions equal to this number for not axes that
	//     are not collapsed.
	//   - indicesAreSorted: can be set to true if its guaranteed that startIndices are sorted (in ascending order,
	//     after scattering its values according to start_index_map) by the user. This allows for some optimizations
	//     in some platforms.
