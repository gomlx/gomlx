//  1. Not implement standard operations by returning an error -- this restricts what type of models it can support.
//     See Backend.Capabilities and package github.com/gomlx/gomlx/backends/notimplemented
//  2. Support specialized operations beyond those defined in this interface -- this requires
//     careful interface casting by the caller (in package github.com/gomlx/gomlx/graph) and
//     fallback to backends that don't support these specialized ops.
