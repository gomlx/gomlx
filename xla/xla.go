// Package xla wraps the XLA functionality, plus extra dependencies.
//
// To set a default platform to use, set the environment variable GOMLX_PLATFORM to the value you want (eg. "Host", "CUDA", "TPU").
//
// One can configure XLA C++ logging with the environment variable TF_CPP_MIN_LOG_LEVEL.
//
// To compile this library requires (see README.md for details on how to install these):
//
//   - gomlx_xla library installed
//   - tcmalloc installed -- part of the `gperftools` library. See README.md.
//     The distribution comes with a pre-compiled libtcmalloc.so, in the `$(INSTALL_DIR)/lib/gomlx/`. You can also copy
//     it from there to a common libraries directory, of include that directory in your `LD_LIBRAY_PATH`.
package xla

// #cgo LDFLAGS: -lgomlx_xla -ltcmalloc
