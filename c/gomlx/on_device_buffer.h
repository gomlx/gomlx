shaped_buffer.h provide a C API around xla::ShapedBuffer, defined in
`tensorflow/compiler/xla/service/shaped_buffer.h`.

Notice the Go API will only see the "C" view of this file (where `__cplusplus`
is not defined). The "C" view should have no includes from tensorflow, so that
the library won't depend on their
